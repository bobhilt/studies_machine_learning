`pipelines1.py`
A pipeline example on iris dataset. 

Created pipelines for  Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier.
For each model, applied scaling, PCA, and initialized the classifier in the pipeline. ,
SVM tied with Decision Tree.  

There was no model tuning (not primary focus here).

The best pipeline was pickled to `best_pipeline.pkl` file.
